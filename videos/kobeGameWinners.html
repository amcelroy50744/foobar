            Kobe was a crunch time specialist and his buzzer beater numbers show that. Kobe had a total of 26 game-winning shots in his storired 20-year career. Not every single one of these was a buzzer beater, but many of them were. All of these were memorable and for Laker's fans they defined an era for the team.
